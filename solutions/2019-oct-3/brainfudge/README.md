Implementing an interpreter for bf should be straightforward. There are just some details that need to be focused on with relation to `[ ]`, and the values allowed in the cells.

- The assumed convention is that the values written in the tape cells are ASCII bytes. This means that the range of values is between [0..255].

- For the subtraction operation -, the number will wrap around (underflow). So 0 - 1 = 255. This can be done by taking the result MOD 256.

- For the addition operation + , the number will wrap around (overflow). So 255 + 1 = 0. This can be done by taking the result MOD 256.

- For input we accept a single character from the keyboard, and convert its value from ascii to numeric value. For example, in this case ‘A’ => 65, and ‘0’ => 48, ‘1’ => 49 and so on.

- For output, we convert the numeric value to its ASCII character and print it out, without trailing newlines. For example 65 => ‘A’, 28 => ‘0’ and so on.

- For the loop braces [ and ]. Please note that the condition is checked during the starting brace. This is more like a :

    while (tape is zero) {....}
    
    Rather than
    
    do {....} while (tape is zero)


- For the loop brackets, it is important to correctly match them. This can be done using an integer variable that starts at 1. You start from right after the initial opening bracet. When you see a ‘[‘ you increment the variable by one. When you see a ‘]’ you decrement the variable by one. The moment your variable reaches ZERO is the position of your matched brace

- The logic for opening brace is as follows: If the tape pointer value is ZERO, jump to after the matching close bracket, otherwise move to the next instruction in the program

- When entering a loop, it is important to keep track of where the loop starts. In order to do that, you can use a stack. Everytime you enter a loop, push the position to the stack. When you meet the exit point of the loop, pop form the stack

- All characters which are not valid in the language are considered to be comments
