Python Addicts meetup no. 1. Thanks to for organising it. An informal chat with other Python enthusiasts over some pizza.

It was interesting to hear from others in the community about:

ðŸ‘‰How they first got into coding
ðŸ‘‰How they use python in their daily jobs
ðŸ‘‰Other interesting facts about them

The future is bright for this one.

ðŸŽ¯There's a whatsapp group for Python Addicts, for sharing ideas, questions and discussions about Python. Comment "interested" bellow to be added to the group.
